# Objective:

The primary objetive for this little application was simply to get some exposure to some net programming in Zig.
Nothing fancy, just a quick lunch break curation of works

# Threaded server:
The server is using threads to respond to requests

# Client
The client can send data and get back the HEX representation of the ASCII data using the same initial socket that the client connects to (bi-directional data transmissions)

# Build
The zig build steps creates both the main application (server) and the client code.
